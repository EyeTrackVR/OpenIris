The goal of this project is to bring an easy to set up hardware and software wise, fast and accurate eye and/or mouth tracking solution for any headset that allows for mounting the eye tracking cameras and/or mouth tracking camera in or under the headset (in case of mouth tracking). 

It is also open source and open hardware meaning anyone can build it for them selfes and use it free of charge. 

This project is highly inspired by the excelent Full Body Trakcing solution - [SlimeVR](https://docs.slimevr.dev) 
and is aimging to do the same - make the eye and mouth tracking technology independted of the headset so that anyone can use it with anything they want and also make it cheaper. 

Goals in phases:

- Iris tracking - we can detect the iris and translate its location to an avatar though OSC / websockets
- Eyelid blink tracking - we can detect blinking of the user and translate it to the character
- Full eyelid tracking - we can detect and estimate the position of eyelids and translate it to the character
- Mouth tracking - we can detect and estimate different mouth poses the user is making and translate them to the character
